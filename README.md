# RavensLabs | CoreOps Game Server Tools

Welcome to **RavensLabs**, where we build **game server management tools** that just work.

We create clean, powerful, and easy-to-use dedicated server managers for games that ship with incomplete or difficult-to-use server hosting tools.

## 🎮 CoreOps Suite
- **AthenaCore** – ARK: Survival Ascended Server Manager
- **AshCore** – 7 Days to Die Server Manager
- **MineCore** – Minecraft Server Manager
- **AloftCore** – Aloft Server Manager
- **ZomboidCore** – Project Zomboid Server Manager

## 🔥 Why We Built This
Many games leave server admins to struggle with:
- Manual shell scripts
- Hard-to-edit config files
- No GUI or management tools
- Limited backup and restore options

RavensLabs solves this by building intuitive, dedicated server management tools that make server hosting accessible to everyone.
